Data Used:
[Data_inc.csv](https://github.com/Aaditya-Sahu/Salary-Prediction-Machine-Learning/files/11729923/Data_inc.csv)

Machile Learning:
Building ML Models using classification different algorithms and comparing their accuracy.

Data Insights:
We can infer various useful insights from the data, I have prepared a presentation that describes the data and the ML Models[Aaditya_Salary_Prediction_Project7_1.odp](https://github.com/Aaditya-Sahu/Salary-Prediction-Machine-Learning/files/11729992/Aaditya_Salary_Prediction_Project7_1.odp)

THe accuracy of different models is illustrated in the following figure:
